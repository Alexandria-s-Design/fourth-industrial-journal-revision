**Re**: Revised Manuscript - "The Fourth Industrial Revolution"

Dear Editor,

Thank you for the opportunity to revise and resubmit our manuscript, "The Fourth Industrial Revolution," for consideration in the Interactive Journal of Global Leadership and Learning. We are grateful to reviewer Ximena for the thoughtful and constructive feedback, which has significantly strengthened our work. We have carefully addressed all ten reviewer comments, including clarifying our research questions to emphasize their qualitative nature, ensuring gender-neutral language throughout, and explicitly identifying participant groups in each research question. We have also enhanced our methodology section by providing detailed recruitment procedures for both district leaders and parent focus group participants, specifying interview and focus group protocols, session durations, and data collection locations, and explicitly naming NVivo as the qualitative data analysis software used for inductive coding and theme development.

These revisions have substantially improved the manuscript's clarity, rigor, and alignment with qualitative research standards. The research questions now stand independently with specific participant identification, the theoretical framework is more clearly positioned, and the methods section provides comprehensive details about our data collection and analysis procedures. We believe these enhancements address all reviewer concerns while maintaining the study's focus on how a superintendent's vision for inquiry-based learning was imagined, produced, employed, and experienced by district leaders and historically marginalized parent communities. We are confident that this revised manuscript makes a valuable contribution to scholarship on educational leadership, equity, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution's implications for K-12 education.

Sincerely,

Marie Martin, Ed.D.
