## Research Questions

The following questions guide this study:

1. How did the superintendent imagine, plan, and communicate a shared vision for inquiry-based learning to the district's cabinet-level leadership team?

2. How did district cabinet members (assistant superintendent, chief operations officer, and instructional directors) experience, interpret, and transfer the superintendent's vision throughout the district?

3. How did parents from historically marginalized communities within the district experience the implementation of inquiry-based learning practices as they relate to classroom equity?

## Theoretical and Conceptual Framework

This study employs two primary theoretical frameworks: (1) Critical Race Theory as articulated by Ladson-Billings and Tate (1995) to center race and equity in understanding how the district's transformation efforts impacted historically marginalized communities, and (2) Sinclair's (1998, 2002) four-phase technology adoption cycle framework (imagined, produced, employed, experienced) to understand how district leaders advanced a vision for inquiry-based learning aligned with the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

## Participants

Due to the nature of their roles within the district, this study focused on five district leaders: the Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent of Instruction, Chief Operations Officer, Director of Innovation, and Director of Equity. Additionally, parent focus groups were conducted with families from historically marginalized communities to understand their experiences with the district's transformation efforts.

District leaders were recruited through purposeful sampling based on their leadership positions and direct involvement in advancing the superintendent's vision for inquiry-based learning. Participants' schedules were coordinated at least one month in advance via email and phone, and introductory letters were sent before the interviews (Creswell, 2016). Parent focus group participants were recruited through school partnerships and community networks to ensure representation from families historically underserved by the district. Appreciative inquiry protocols (Ludema et al., 2006; Stratton-Berkessel, 2010) guided the parent focus group sessions to center community voice and experiences with the district's equity-focused transformation.

## Data Collection

Interview questions for district leaders focused on four key areas aligned with Sinclair's (1998) technology framework: (1) how they imagined and interpreted the superintendent's vision for inquiry-based learning, (2) how they planned and produced capacity-building initiatives, (3) how they employed resources and strategies to implement the vision, and (4) their perspectives on how historically marginalized communities experienced the transformation. Parent focus group discussions centered on families' experiences with the district's equity-focused transformation efforts, successes they observed, and their aspirations for continued improvement.

Individual interviews with district leaders ranged from 60-90 minutes, while parent focus group sessions lasted 90-120 minutes. Interviews were conducted both in-person at the district office and school sites, as well as via Zoom video conferencing to accommodate participant schedules and COVID-19 safety protocols.

## Data Analysis

Participant interview data were analyzed using NVivo qualitative data analysis software to support inductive coding and allow for organic themes to arise (Creswell, 2016). This approach enabled findings to resonate and fall within the conceptual framework of Sinclair's (2002) four-phase technology adoption cycle and Critical Race Theory perspectives on educational equity. All interview transcripts, artifacts (board meeting notes, participant presentations), and field notes were uploaded into NVivo to facilitate systematic coding and theme development.
